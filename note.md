questions:
- how to handle a server that has been left far behind. let it sync with the leader or remove it.

todos:
- handle addtion and removal of servers
- add validation before remove or add new server
- support static cluster
- write test :')
- fix client interaction
- support log compaction
- using try-lock instead

- new cluster created
    - start the first server -> leader
    - add additional servers, let's these servers catch-up with leader
